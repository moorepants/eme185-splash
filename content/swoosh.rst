Jumping studies in which a person jumps repeatedly for thirty seconds or longer
are conducted assuming the person being tested is giving his or her best effort
with every jump. However, the data collected from such studies shows this is
likely not the case. The team was tasked with designing and building an
adaptive target that adjusted to the performance of the subject. A ceiling
mounted design using a basketball controlled by three pulleys was selected as
the concept to be built. The height of the basketball is controlled by a
stepper motor and Arduino Uno, and responds to two proximity sensors and an
accelerometer which indicates the test subject’s jump heights. This design was
chosen because it was simple to build, easy to store away, and is the best way
satisfy all of our sponsor’s needs and suggestions.
