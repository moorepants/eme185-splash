Micro-Vu Corporation designs and manufactures optical measurement machines. As
a California based manufacturer, automation is critical to keeping costs low.
To reduce labor intensive processes, Micro-Vu developed a semi-automatic cut
and drill station for 14' wooden boards in the summer of 2015. The primary
purpose of this project is to design, manufacture, assemble, and verify an
automated board-loader and unloader to fully automate the custom cut and drill
station. The solution to this challenge includes pneumatics to simplify the
movement of materials, brushless DC motors to transfer boards from storage
locations to the infeed table, sensors for material location verification, and
PLC programming for the interaction of each component. The final product has
the capability of running unattended for 2 hours and only requires additional
loading of material to continue production.
