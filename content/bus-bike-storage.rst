BikeLeap had tasked our team with the development of a folding bike storage
solution inside the luggage compartment of an existing motor coach; we have
delivered a full-scale functioning demo unit of the final design compatible
with the Brompton bicycle and Van Hool Tx coach models. This report details how
the end product meets the needs, specifications, and standards set by the
client. It also consists of relevant manufacturing instructions for
construction of the prototype and justification for the design decisions
underlying key parts and assemblies.
