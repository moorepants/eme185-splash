This group was challenged to create a machine capable of automatically tying a
shoe with a budget of $600. Additionally, the machine could only use two
actuators and no manual intervention. It was judged on the speed of tying, its
success rate, and the amount of energy consumed. The final design utlized a
custom transmission to provide three degree of freedom control of a hook end
effector. The machine was successful at tying both stages of the knot and may
be the first publicly demonstrated machine to do so. See the machine in action
