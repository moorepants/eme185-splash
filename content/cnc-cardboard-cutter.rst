The team "From Here to Woodland" has designed and built a safe CNC machine
capable of cutting cardboard with the ultimate goal of providing students the
opportunity to learn about CNC machines and use the knowledge to make
prototypes of their ideas. The machine is completely open source and made from
easily obtainable parts, making it cheaper than comparable 3D printing methods.
The CNC Cardboard Cutter allows students to cut shapes out of cardboard or make
fold lines in the cardboard from an engraving pass. The cut and fold lines are
used to fit the 2D pieces together and make 3D parts for a variety of
applications which include making templates for painting, sheet metal work or
even art projects.
