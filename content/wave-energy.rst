The ocean holds a vast potential of energy, that if effectively converted,
could be used as a plentiful and reliable source of renewable energy. One way
to capture that energy is through the use of wave energy converters (WEC),
machines that convert the motion of ocean waves into clean electricity. One
possible approach to increasing the use of ocean power in the United States,
and gaining support from the general population, is to give the public access
to a basic design that individuals or collective groups could build and improve
upon. Our goal was to develop the basic framework for a wave energy converter
(WEC) and share this information with the public.

To achieve this objective, a team of five mechanical engineering students
designed, built, and tested a fully functioning wave energy converter with the
goal of generating 150 watts of peak power. The WEC was engineered to be
modular, capable of being transported by a light-duty vehicle, and constructed
using off-the-shelf components and parts. To validate the system design, the
team conducted ocean testing in Bodega Bay, California, and measured power
output over the period of five days. Due to premature mechanical failure of the
generator coupling, the device was only able to produce a peak power of 38
watts. Even though the device failed to meet the expected power output, the
team has compiled the following information and shared it on this website in
hopes of encouraging others to take on similar projects and make improvements
to the work that has already been done.
