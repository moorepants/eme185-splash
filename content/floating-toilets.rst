For this mechanical engineering senior design capstone project the students
worked on improving sanitation in floating communities along the Tonle Sap lake
in Cambodia.

The students partnered with Wetlands Work! (WW!), a social enterprise based in
Cambodia that designs sanitation and wastewater treatment solutions. The
HandyPod is a sanitation solution designed by WW! for use in floating
communities along the Tonle Sap lake. Pilot studies indicate that the HandyPod
system is very effective at reducing pathogenic content in the lake. However,
its $150 price tag is somewhat cost prohibitive. Furthermore, the current
system is built for use with floating houses and is thus not viable for use
with stilted houses and other types of houses along the lake.

The overall goal of the partnership with WW! was to increase uptake of the
HandyPod system among residents of the floating communities. To achieve this
goal the students focused on two main objectives: (1) minimizing the cost of
the system and (2) adapting the system for use with stilted houses.
