Buffalo Bicycles is a non-profit organization that aims to use bicycles to help
people in poverty overcome challenges of transportation in rural, developing
areas. They provide improved access to education and medical assistance while
also improving the food distribution capacity of local farmers.

The students were given us the task of improving the kick-stand that goes with
the Buffalo Bike. This stand allows users to load 100 kg of cargo and
facilitates use of the bike as a power take-off.  While the stand possessed
enough strength, it often failed at critical components and is too expensive.
The goal was to redesign the stand to fix these problems. The students lowered
the production cost by 13% while maintaining strength and simplifying
fabrication.
