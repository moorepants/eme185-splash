This group was tasked with developing an "open source" power wheelchair which
could be built, maintained, and modified using off-the-shelf components that
helps serve the broader goal to give people with disabilities an option to
build their own chairs without relying on expensive and bureaucratic medical
supply companies. The final design uses readily available parts, is quickly and
easily repairable, and is built using only garage tools. The students
demonstrated a fully working chassis with electronic controls that met the
desired specifications and is thus be able to perform at a level at or above
the current chairs available on the market.
