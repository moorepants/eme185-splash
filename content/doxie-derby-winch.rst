Every year, UC Davis undergraduate engineering students have the opportunity to
display their work at an engineering design showcase in June. This year, a team
of mechanical engineers, by the request of the UC Davis Veterinary Medicine
school, improved the out-of-date pulley system used during the much-adored
Doxie Derby event on Picnic Day.
