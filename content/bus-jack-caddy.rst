A caddy was constructed to aid in the installation and removal of a Stertil
Koni JB­160 rolling jack onto a Stertil Koni SkyLift. The purpose of the caddy
is to eliminate the need for an additional recess in the ground that would have
been added to house the permanently mounted jack. The target of the project was
to produce a deliverable that was easy to repair, durable, and economically
feasible. The identified sub­problems that had to be considered were
maneuverability, lifting mechanism, and effectively interface with the lift.
These factors all play an equally important role in the performance and
structural integrity of the caddy because after all, the caddy has to be able
to withstand a heavy load while lifting the jack up to be mounted onto the
SkyLift as well as travel environment of the Unitrans facility. Some
specifications of the caddy are a total minimum weight of 800lbs, a steel
construction, and a base size of about twelve square feet. A fully complete and
working jack was delivered to Unitrans.
