Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that gradually disables the
motor functions of the body. Our project is to adapt a proof-of-concept
joystick-driven tricycle so that it can be used by an individual with late
stage ALS. Our client is able to control his head movement as well as the
extension of his legs. The overall usability and reliability of the system will
be addressed in an effort to bring the Quadriplegic Friendly Tricycle closer to
production quality. This project will involve adding secure electronic
connections, developing a more user friendly interface, and increasing the
factors of safety in the steering and braking subsystems.
