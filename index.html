        is the culmination of our students' Bachelor of Science in Mechanical
        Engineering. Student groups are paired with a client who provides a

        industry partners and startup efforts to research institutions and
        non-profits.</p>

        <p class="justify">The students work closely with the client and our
        faculty mentors over a period of approximately five months to design
        and deliver a solution. The clients are responsible for articulating a
        need through a proposal, working closely with the students over the
        course of the project, and providing funding and resources for the
        group's success.</p>

        <h2>Call for Proposals</h2>
        <hr class="star-primary">
        <p>Do you have an idea to address a pressing need? Do you have a need
        for a device or process to improve your product or to enhance your
        research? Consider interacting with the department's Mechanical
        Engineering Capstone Design course!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>The Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department is soliciting
        project ideas appropriate for a team of 4 to 5 undergraduate mechanical
        engineers to tackle from January to June 2018. Teams of students
        work to conceptualize, design, implement, and test a functional
        prototype by the end of the course that meets the client's needs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>Approximately thirty proposals will be selected for the program.
        The projects often result in a finished prototype or, at the least,
        detailed plans for its implementation. The best projects are able to be
        completed in a 5-month time period, are well beyond simple fabrication
        needs, and maximize student generated creative input.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
        <p>The courses will culminate with the College of Engineering's <a
          href="http://engineering.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/senior-engineering-design-showcase/">
          Design Showcase</a> where selected clients and industry patners will
          judge the teams' work.
        </p>

        <p>If interested, please provide a proposal in the following form that
        addresses:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The problem or need you require a solution for</li>
          <li>Background information</li>
          <li>Desired outcomes and goals</li>
          <li>Design requirements and specifications</li>
          <li>Contact information for one or more persons able to provide
            student mentorship</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The course instructors will review the projects, select the number
        needed for the course, and match them to qualified student teams. We
        will follow up with a phone call and/or email during December to
        discuss your proposal.</p>

              We only can promise that you will receive the design reports that are created by the students. Many clients also receive a prototype of their design. But if you request a prototype, we cannot make any guarantee that it will be completed or that it will work as desired. Keep in mind that for many of the students, this is their first real engineering project. This experience is often considered an excellent way to recruit new employees and a way to connect with our department so we can better train our students for you.

              The best projects are primarily solvable by mechanical means (machine design, dynamics, fluid mechanics, thermal mechanics, control systems, etc). The projects should not be critical to your organization's mission nor should they be projects that will not help your organization. The best projects are those that you would benefit greatly from if successful but that you do not necessarily have the resources available to tackle it.

              Your student team will approach you at the beginning of the course to arrange for an informational interview to learn more about your specific need. This can happen through a site visit or via phone/video conferencing. Over the course of the five months, the students will communicate with you regularly for information gathering purposes and feedback on their design progress. If you can provide technical mentorship, the students may desire more of your time. We expect that you will be reasonably available for the students over the period of the course. The minimum for success is likely around one meeting per two weeks. We recommend one meeting per week. The more you interact with the students, the higher likelihood of a solution that meets and/or exceeds your expectations. We will work to make sure that the students in turn will give their best effort to deliver a working design and/or prototype, communicate effectively with you about their process, and be respectful of your time. You will also be invited to participate in the design reviews and the Engineering Design Showcase.

Also note that, in general, the University does not claim IP on undergraduate coursework outcomes.

              No, we have 150+ students and 30+ projects to organize. It is a non-trivial task to assign students to projects in an equitable and optimal way for all parties. We survey the students and using the data, form teams. Our first priority is to get students assigned to projects that they want to work on. Secondly, we use a number of indicators to form teams that will maximize success for all students in the team. This method generally creates teams that have around the same collective performance as each other team.

At the minimum other students in the class, the instructors, and visitors to the design reviews and design showcase will see what the students present. The instructors will see all of the details in the student's reports, etc. Nothing has to be posted publicly beyond that.

              It is easiest for us to manage students from our course, but there are opportunities to pair with other engineering disciplines. For example the Computer Science department and the Biomedical department's courses occur during the same time as ours and we have had success pairing with them in the past. Please contact early about trying to develop a multidisciplinary team.

              No, you do not have to be an engineer. If you are an engineer or otherwise technically knowledgable in the field you are welcome and encouraged to mentor the student on the engineering aspects of the project.

              The instructor's primary role is to guide the students through the design process and to provide technical feedback. We will work with the students to define the scope of the project and to set deliverables for periodic review. This process works best when early focus is on the client's needs, so that students do not go into the project with a preconceived solution in mind. In fact, they are encouraged to consider multiple possible solution strategies before settling on one to implement. Your support of this process is encouraged.

It is up to you to find a suitable client and/or develop the competition rules. You must contact the instructors early in the Fall quarter to discuss your ideas.

              Yes, you may be able to use your work from your competition team. The work will have to start from the design phase at the beginning of class and it is best to have a small portion of the project that isn't necessarily critical to the success of the team. Please see one of the instructors as soon as possible to discuss the possibilities.

              No, we have 150+ students and 30+ projects to organize. It is a non-trivial task to assign students to projects in an equitable and optimal way for all parties involved. We survey the students and using the data, form teams. Our first priority is to get students assigned to projects that they want to work on. Secondly, we use a number of indicators to form teams that will maximize success for all students in the team. This method generally creates teams that have around the same collective performance as each other team.

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that gradually disables the
motor functions of the body. Our project is to adapt a proof-of-concept
joystick-driven tricycle so that it can be used by an individual with late
stage ALS. Our client is able to control his head movement as well as the
extension of his legs. The overall usability and reliability of the system will
be addressed in an effort to bring the Quadriplegic Friendly Tricycle closer to
production quality. This project will involve adding secure electronic
connections, developing a more user friendly interface, and increasing the
factors of safety in the steering and braking subsystems.</p>

<p>Jumping studies in which a person jumps repeatedly for thirty seconds or longer
are conducted assuming the person being tested is giving his or her best effort
with every jump. However, the data collected from such studies shows this is
likely not the case. The team was tasked with designing and building an
adaptive target that adjusted to the performance of the subject. A ceiling
mounted design using a basketball controlled by three pulleys was selected as
the concept to be built. The height of the basketball is controlled by a
stepper motor and Arduino Uno, and responds to two proximity sensors and an
accelerometer which indicates the test subject’s jump heights. This design was
chosen because it was simple to build, easy to store away, and is the best way
satisfy all of our sponsor’s needs and suggestions.</p>

<p>Micro-Vu Corporation designs and manufactures optical measurement machines. As
a California based manufacturer, automation is critical to keeping costs low.
To reduce labor intensive processes, Micro-Vu developed a semi-automatic cut
and drill station for 14' wooden boards in the summer of 2015. The primary
purpose of this project is to design, manufacture, assemble, and verify an
automated board-loader and unloader to fully automate the custom cut and drill
station. The solution to this challenge includes pneumatics to simplify the
movement of materials, brushless DC motors to transfer boards from storage
locations to the infeed table, sensors for material location verification, and
PLC programming for the interaction of each component. The final product has
the capability of running unattended for 2 hours and only requires additional
loading of material to continue production.</p>

<p>A caddy was constructed to aid in the installation and removal of a Stertil
Koni JB­160 rolling jack onto a Stertil Koni SkyLift. The purpose of the caddy
is to eliminate the need for an additional recess in the ground that would have
been added to house the permanently mounted jack. The target of the project was
to produce a deliverable that was easy to repair, durable, and economically
feasible. The identified sub­problems that had to be considered were
maneuverability, lifting mechanism, and effectively interface with the lift.
These factors all play an equally important role in the performance and
structural integrity of the caddy because after all, the caddy has to be able
to withstand a heavy load while lifting the jack up to be mounted onto the
SkyLift as well as travel environment of the Unitrans facility. Some
specifications of the caddy are a total minimum weight of 800lbs, a steel
construction, and a base size of about twelve square feet. A fully complete and
working jack was delivered to Unitrans.</p>

<p>The team &quot;From Here to Woodland&quot; has designed and built a safe CNC machine
capable of cutting cardboard with the ultimate goal of providing students the
opportunity to learn about CNC machines and use the knowledge to make
prototypes of their ideas. The machine is completely open source and made from
easily obtainable parts, making it cheaper than comparable 3D printing methods.
The CNC Cardboard Cutter allows students to cut shapes out of cardboard or make
fold lines in the cardboard from an engraving pass. The cut and fold lines are
used to fit the 2D pieces together and make 3D parts for a variety of
applications which include making templates for painting, sheet metal work or
even art projects.</p>

<p>This group was tasked with developing an &quot;open source&quot; power wheelchair which
could be built, maintained, and modified using off-the-shelf components that
helps serve the broader goal to give people with disabilities an option to
build their own chairs without relying on expensive and bureaucratic medical
supply companies. The final design uses readily available parts, is quickly and
easily repairable, and is built using only garage tools. The students
demonstrated a fully working chassis with electronic controls that met the
desired specifications and is thus be able to perform at a level at or above
the current chairs available on the market.</p>

<p>For this mechanical engineering senior design capstone project the students
worked on improving sanitation in floating communities along the Tonle Sap lake
in Cambodia.</p>
<p>The students partnered with Wetlands Work! (WW!), a social enterprise based in
Cambodia that designs sanitation and wastewater treatment solutions. The
HandyPod is a sanitation solution designed by WW! for use in floating
communities along the Tonle Sap lake. Pilot studies indicate that the HandyPod
system is very effective at reducing pathogenic content in the lake. However,
its $150 price tag is somewhat cost prohibitive. Furthermore, the current
system is built for use with floating houses and is thus not viable for use
with stilted houses and other types of houses along the lake.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the partnership with WW! was to increase uptake of the
HandyPod system among residents of the floating communities. To achieve this
goal the students focused on two main objectives: (1) minimizing the cost of
the system and (2) adapting the system for use with stilted houses.</p>

<p>The current crush pad cleanup at most wineries is grossly water inefficient.
This design is an autonomous proof-of-concept industrial winery floor care
robot. The battery powered device can effectively dislodge and collect solid
grape waste from typical winery concrete flooring with minimal water use.</p>

<p>The ocean holds a vast potential of energy, that if effectively converted,
could be used as a plentiful and reliable source of renewable energy. One way
to capture that energy is through the use of wave energy converters (WEC),
machines that convert the motion of ocean waves into clean electricity. One
possible approach to increasing the use of ocean power in the United States,
and gaining support from the general population, is to give the public access
to a basic design that individuals or collective groups could build and improve
upon. Our goal was to develop the basic framework for a wave energy converter
(WEC) and share this information with the public.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://moorepants.github.io/eme185-splash/images/wave-energy-buoy-construction.jpg" />
<p>To achieve this objective, a team of five mechanical engineering students
designed, built, and tested a fully functioning wave energy converter with the
goal of generating 150 watts of peak power. The WEC was engineered to be
modular, capable of being transported by a light-duty vehicle, and constructed
using off-the-shelf components and parts. To validate the system design, the
team conducted ocean testing in Bodega Bay, California, and measured power
output over the period of five days. Due to premature mechanical failure of the
generator coupling, the device was only able to produce a peak power of 38
watts. Even though the device failed to meet the expected power output, the
team has compiled the following information and shared it on this website in
hopes of encouraging others to take on similar projects and make improvements
to the work that has already been done.</p>

<p>Easter Seals, an organization dedicated to enriching the lives of those with
autism and other disabilities, tasked us with the design and construction of a
portable treadmill for young children diagnosed with motor disabilities.
Therapeutic use of a treadmill at a young age can accelerate the development of
a child's walking skills. Our pediatric treadmill is designed to fit the
everyday family household. The core concepts of the treadmill's features
closely mirror industrial treadmill design, including the use of a walking
belt, rollers, and an electric motor drivetrain. Intuitive and safe controls
are provided for a supervising adult to operate at speeds in the range of 0.1
to 1.0 miles per hour. Other features of the pediatric treadmill are that it is
lightweight, transportable, and has low initial and maintenance costs.  The
design of the pediatric treadmill aims to provide a viable and long-lasting
solution for promoting development of motor skills in children.</p>
