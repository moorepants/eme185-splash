For Clients:
    What do I receive from this relationship?: >
        We only can promise that you will receive the design reports that are
        created by the students. If you request a prototype, we cannot make any
        guarantee that it will be completed or that it will work as desired.
        Keep in mind that for many of the students, this is their first real
        engineering project.
    What are the best types of projects for the course?: >
        The best projects are primarily solvable by mechanical means (machine
        design, dynamics, fluid mechanics, thermal mechanics, control systems,
        etc). The projects should not be critical to your organization's
        mission nor should they be projects that will not help your
        organization. The best projects are those that you would benefit
        greatly from if successful but that you do not necessarily have the
        resources available to tackle it.
    What is the role of the client?: >
        Your student team will approach you at the beginning of the course to
        arrange for an informational interview to learn more about your
        specific need. This can happen through a site visit or via phone/video
        conferencing. Over the course of the five months, the students will
        communicate with you regularly for information gathering purposes and
        feedback on their design progress. If you can provide technical
        mentorship, the students may desire more of your time. We expect that
        you will be reasonably available for the students over the period of
        the course. The minimum for success is likely around one to two
        meetings per two weeks. The more you interact with the students, the
        higher likelihood of a solution that meets and/or exceeds your
        expectations. We will work to make sure that the students in turn will
        give their best effort to deliver a working design and/or prototype,
        communicate effectively with you about their process, and be respectful
        of your time. You will also be invited to participate in the design
        reviews and the Engineering Design Showcase.
    What are the instructor's roles?: >
        The instructor's primary role is to guide the students through the
        design process and to provide technical feedback. We will work with the
        students to define the scope of the project and to set deliverables for
        periodic review. This process works best when early focus is on the
        sponsor need, so that students do not go into the project with a
        preconceived solution in mind. In fact, they are encouraged to consider
        multiple possible solution strategies before settling on one to
        implement. Your support of this process is encouraged.
    Am I guaranteed to get a group of students?: >
        No, we will likely have around 60 proposals and only 30-33 of them will
        be selected based on student fit and preference. Be sure to submit a
        strong proposal. You can see past proposals on the <a
        href="http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/projects.html">course
        website</a>.
    Do I have to be an engineer to be a client?: >
        No, you do not have to be an engineer. If you are an engineer or
        otherwise technically knowledgable in the field you are welcome and
        encouraged to mentor the student on the engineering aspects of the
        project. But if you aren't you only need to supply your domain specific
        knowledge and related feedback.
    Do I have to pay any money to participate?: >
        We ask that all industry clients and capable donors make a tax
        deductible donation of $3000 dollars to the program. Others can donate
        on a sliding scale. In addition, the client is expected to cover the
        costs of construction if a physical prototype is requested.
    My project involves intellectual property. Can you accommodate IP needs?: >
        The best projects for the course are those that are not tied to
        intellectual property as it alleviates any issues associated with
        sharing the students' work for course evaluation purposes. But we may
        be able to accommodate some needs, so please contact us for more
        details. This will ultimately be a conversation among the students,
        client, and instructors. Also note that, in general, the University
        does not claim IP on undergraduate coursework outcomes.
For Students:
    Can students submit proposals?: >
        Yes, students can submit proposals but you must have a client that is
        not part of your team. It is up to you to find a suitable client. You
        must contact the instructors early in the Fall quarter to discuss your
        ideas.
    Can my work with an engineering competition team be used for senior design?: >
        Yes, you may be able to use your work from your competition team. The
        work will have to start from the design phase at the beginning of
        class. Please see one of the instructors as soon as possible to discuss
        the possibilities.
