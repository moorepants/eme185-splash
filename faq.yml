For Clients:
    What do I receive from this relationship?: >
        We only can promise that you will receive the design reports that are
        created by the students. Many clients also receive a prototype of their
        design. But if you request a prototype, we cannot make any guarantee
        that it will be completed or that it will work as desired. Keep in mind
        that for many of the students, this is their first real engineering
        project. This experience is often considered an excellent way to
        recruit new employees and a way to connect with our department so we
        can better train our students for you.
    What are the best types of projects for the course?: >
        The best projects are primarily solvable by mechanical means (machine
        design, dynamics, fluid mechanics, thermal mechanics, control systems,
        etc). The projects should not be critical to your organization's
        mission nor should they be projects that will not help your
        organization. The best projects are those that you would benefit
        greatly from if successful but that you do not necessarily have the
        resources available to tackle it.
    What is the role of the client?: >
        Your student team will approach you at the beginning of the course to
        arrange for an informational interview to learn more about your
        specific need. This can happen through a site visit or via phone/video
        conferencing. Over the course of the five months, the students will
        communicate with you regularly for information gathering purposes and
        feedback on their design progress. If you can provide technical
        mentorship, the students may desire more of your time. We expect that
        you will be reasonably available for the students over the period of
        the course. The minimum for success is likely around one meeting per
        two weeks. We recommend one meeting per week. The more you interact
        with the students, the higher likelihood of a solution that meets
        and/or exceeds your expectations. We will work to make sure that the
        students in turn will give their best effort to deliver a working
        design and/or prototype, communicate effectively with you about their
        process, and be respectful of your time. You will also be invited to
        participate in the design reviews and the Engineering Design Showcase.
    What are the instructor's roles?: >
        The instructor's primary role is to guide the students through the
        design process and to provide technical feedback. We will work with the
        students to define the scope of the project and to set deliverables for
        periodic review. This process works best when early focus is on the
        client's needs, so that students do not go into the project with a
        preconceived solution in mind. In fact, they are encouraged to consider
        multiple possible solution strategies before settling on one to
        implement. Your support of this process is encouraged.
    Am I guaranteed to get a group of students?: >
        No, we will likely have around 60 proposals and only 30-35 of them will
        be selected based on student fit and preference. Be sure to submit a
        strong proposal.
    Do I have to be an engineer to be a client?: >
        No, you do not have to be an engineer. If you are an engineer or
        otherwise technically knowledgable in the field you are welcome and
        encouraged to mentor the student on the engineering aspects of the
        project. But if you aren't you only need to supply your domain specific
        knowledge and related feedback.
    Do I have to pay any money to participate?: >
        We ask that all industry clients and capable donors make a tax
        deductible donation of $3000 dollars to the program. Others can donate
        on a sliding scale. In addition, the client is expected to cover the
        costs of construction if a physical prototype is requested.
    My project involves intellectual property. Can you accommodate IP needs, i.e an NDA?: >
        The best projects for the course are those that are not tied to
        intellectual property as it alleviates any issues associated with
        sharing the students' work for course evaluation purposes. But we may
        be able to accommodate some needs, so please contact us for more
        details well in advance. This will ultimately be a conversation among
        the students, client, and instructors. Also note that, in general, the
        University does not claim IP on undergraduate coursework outcomes.
    Will the products from the project be available in the public domain?: >
        No, definitely not in the public domain. At the minimum other students
        in the class, the instructors, and visitors to the design reviews and
        design showcase will see what the students present. The instructors
        will see all of the details in the student's reports, etc. Nothing has
        to be posted publicly beyond that.
    Will the students' solutions be owned by the University?: >
        The University claims no IP on things generated from undergraduate
        course work. The client and the students must work out an ownership
        agreement with respect to the products generated. We advise our
        students to discuss this early on in the process with the client and to
        get advice from our tech transfer office.
    Mechanical engineering students alone may not be able to solve my problem. Can I work with a mixture of disciplines?: >
        It is easiest for us to manage students from our course, but there are
        opportunities to pair with other engineering disciplines. For example
        the Computer Science department and the Biomedical department's courses
        occur during the same time as ours and we have had success pairing with
        them in the past. Please contact early about trying to develop a
        multidisciplinary team.
    Can I work with more that one team?: >
        We typically get more proposals than the number of teams available, so
        it is not very likely that more than one proposal from one client is
        accepted. Excellent proposals will be considered though.
For Students:
    Can students submit proposals?: >
        Yes, a single student can submit proposals but the proposal must either
        have an identified external client that is not part of your team,
        must be part of an official engineering competition, or it must be
        framed as an engineering competition which has rules that mirror rules
        from existing engineering competitions. It is up to you to find a
        suitable client and/or develop the competition rules. You must contact
        the instructors early in the Fall quarter to discuss your ideas.
    Can my work with an engineering competition team be used for senior design?: >
        Yes, you may be able to use your work from your competition team. The
        work will have to start from the design phase at the beginning of
        class and it is best to have a small portion of the project that isn't
        necessarily critical to the success of the team. Please see one of the
        instructors as soon as possible to discuss the possibilities.
